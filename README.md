	-What is Backtracking Alorithm?
		Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively 
  		by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing 
		those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any
  		point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching 
		any level of the search tree).

	-What is Backtracking Algorithm (MRV)?
		It does the same thing that Backtracking does however before it starts to 
  		search, it checks the variables according to the range provided, sometimes 
		puting the variable in ascending order.
